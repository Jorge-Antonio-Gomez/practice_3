 to save the file.

 If you have selected text with the mark, you will be prompted to save
 only the selected portion to a separate file.  To reduce the chance of
 overwriting the current file with just a portion of it, the current
 filename is not the default in this mode.

 The following function keys are available in Write File mode:

^G     (F1)      Display this help text
^C               Cancel the current function

M-D              Toggle the use of DOS format
M-M              Toggle the use of Mac format
M-A              Toggle appending
M-P              Toggle prepending
M-B              Toggle backing up of the original file

^T               Go to file browser
